This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Cloning the repository

Run the following commmand to clone this project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yaqoobhisbani/PokemonApp.git
```

## Step 2: Installing Dependencies

Once you have cloned this project, navigate to this project in your terminal using cd command. For example `cd PokemonApp`.

Then run the following command for installing dependencies

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn
```

### iOS

For iOS, you need to install CocoaPods dependencies also, which can be done using following commmand.

```sh
# Using NPX from root directly
npx pod-install ios

# OR
cd ios
pod install
```

You should have your dependencies install now.

## Step 3: Running the app

After installing dependencies, we can run the app using folllowing steps.

First we need to start Metro, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

### 3.1: Start Metro server

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using yarn
yarn start
```

> **Note**: The start script is configured to use the `BASE_URL` environment variable. If you need to change it, please have a look at `start` script in `package.json` file.

### 3.2: Build and run the app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

## Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰

You've successfully run this project. ðŸ¥³

# Running Test Cases

This project is configured to use jest for test runner. Simply run the following command to run the test cases.

```sh
# Using npm
